# ðŸ”¥ FiRe: Financial Reinforcement Learning by Trality

Welcome to FiRe!
FiRe is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline built to research Single- and 
Multi-Objective trading algorithms.


## What is supported?
- Critic-only Deep Q-Learning RL agent with Hindsight Experience Replay
[link](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-q-learning-tutorial-mindqn-2a4c855abffc)
- Single- and Multi-Objective reward learning with generalization in the sense of
\[[Friedman, Fontaine](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06364)\]
- MLP-type agentâ€™s Neural Network
- Four reward mechanisms (last logarithmic return, average logarithmic return,
Sharpe Ratio, profit only when closing)


## Install
We recommend python version `3.10`. (Check your version with `python3 --version`)

We recommend using a virtual environment: to create it, run
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
in the repository's main folder.

Install the required packages and download the Bitcoin dataset by running
```
make
```
in the main folder.


## Test

To test the code you can run the sin-wave example:
```
python3 main.py parameters/sin_wave_test_multi.json
```


## How to run an experiment
In order to run a particular experiments run the `main.py` script adding as
argument a json configuration file:
```
python3 main.py <your configuration file>.json
```
the json configuration file contains information about:
- The chosen dataset
- The reward or set of rewards to use
- Q-Learning general parameters
- Neural Network hyperparameters

Experiments results are stored in the `results_of_experiments` folder, each
subfolder contains the results of each single experiment.


## Reproduce experiments in paper (Bitcoin dataset only)
We provide all configuration files for the experiments on the Bitcoin dataset
that are shown in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04579).
To run the experiments use:
```
git checkout e2bc651b07eec388ee0b03228e0acdee8550ba7d
sh scripts/run_experiments_in_folder.sh parameters/paper_plots
```


## How to run walk forward validation
In order to run a walk forward validation run the `walk_forward_validation.py` script with the following arguments:
```
python walk_forward_validation.py --config <json configuration file> --n_folds <number of folds>
```

you can add the argument `--anchored` if you want the train set of each fold to start at the same point.

You can add the argument `--jobs <number of jobs>` if you want to parallelize the execution.


The given configuration file specifies the configuration of the experiment of the first fold, the following folds will be based on the same configuration but with different datasets.

Currently it's not possible to run walk forward validation with synthetic datasets.


## Datasets
For the simulation we discussed in our paper we used the following datasets:
- Cryptocurrency price data (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, XRPUSDT) from Binance exchange, downloaded through Binance API
- Stocks price data (AAPL, SPY), downloaded from Yahoo!finance through `yfinance` python package
- Nifty50 minute close price, downloaded from Kaggle

You can download all cryptocurrencies and stocks datasets by running:
```
make datasets
```
that will run the `download_datasets.sh` script (this is not necessary if you already ran `make`)

Nifty50 dataset can instead be downloaded from kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data)


## Latex for plots
If you want to use latex to create the plots you need to install the following
packages:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra dvipng
```
You can now set `"text.usetex": True,` at the top of `src/plots.py`.
